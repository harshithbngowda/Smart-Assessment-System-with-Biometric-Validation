      "type": "descriptive",
      "student_answer": "kdnefllDdADNLK",
      "correct_answer": "An API is a set of protocols, tools, and definitions that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats applications can use to request and exchange information. APIs are important because they enable integration between systems, promote code reusability, simplify development, and allow developers to use third-party services without understanding their internal implementation."

Advantages: Separation of concerns, easier testing and maintenance, parallel development, code reusability, and flexibility to change one component without affecting others."
